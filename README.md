For code editing, I used Visual Studio.

In the code, each title begins with a comment to make it easier to locate specific sections of code.

I adjusted all paragraph titles and sizes to match the layout displayed in the Word document.

In the "Value and Duration" section, I increased the font size for "Notes" and added a line of space between all four paragraphs to align with the Word document's formatting.

I added hyperlinks to all relevant paragraphs.

In the "Tier 2 Justifications" paragraph, I created a style named .notes, which highlights the entire line in yellow to emphasize its importance, as specified in the Word document.

I made the bullet points bolder to match the requirements outlined in the Word document.

In the "Full Nomination in Conjunction with a Justification" paragraph, I ensured that the second paragraph was highlighted, with certain letters in bold.

I created a table with column titles having a gray background color.

I added bullet points to the paragraphs.

In the "Nomination Deadlines and Related Dates" section, I included a hyperlink with a number just after the column name in the second column.
